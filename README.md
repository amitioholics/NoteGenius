## 🧠 Tech Stack

- Framework: Next.js 15 (App Router), React, TypeScript  
- Styling: Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui  
- AI: Vercel AI SDK with OpenAI models (with local fallbacks)  
- Data: Lightweight JSON (demo) via Next.js Route Handlers  
- Tooling: Vercel (deploy), ESLint/TS

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1) Clone and install

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd notegenius
pnpm install
# or: npm install / yarn
```

### 2) Environment variables

Create the following environment variables in your environment (or in Vercel Project Settings → Environment Variables):

- `OPENAI_API_KEY` — required for AI features (the app still works without it using local fallbacks)
- `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` — only if you add Vercel Blob features later

### 3) Run the dev server

```bash
pnpm dev
# or: npm run dev / yarn dev
```

Visit http://localhost:3000

## 🧪 How to Use

1) Create a new note using “New Note”  
2) Add your content in the Editor tab  
3) Use the tabs:
   - Summary: Generate a detailed summary  
   - Keywords: Extract and copy key concepts  
   - Quiz: Generate MCQs, select answers, and view score  
4) Add tags for better organization

Notes are stored in a local JSON file (demo) and managed via API endpoints.

---

## 📦 Project Structure (key files)

- `app/page.tsx` — main UI, tabs, and interactions  
- `lib/ai-helpers.ts` — AI integration + local fallback algorithms  
- `app/api/notes/route.ts` — JSON-based CRUD for demo storage  
- `components/*` — Note editor, list, dialogs, keyword cards, etc.  
- `app/globals.css` — theme tokens, animations, micro-interactions

---

## 🔌 API (Demo)

Base path: `/api/notes`

- GET `/api/notes` — fetch all notes  
- POST `/api/notes` — create a note  
  - body: `{ title: string, content: string, tags?: string[] }`
- PUT `/api/notes` — update a note  
  - body: `{ id: string, title: string, content: string, tags: string[] }`
- DELETE `/api/notes?id=<noteId>` — delete a note

Data is saved at `/data/notes.json` (auto-created).

---

## 🤖 AI Details

- Default: OpenAI model via the Vercel AI SDK  
- Fallbacks: If `OPENAI_API_KEY` is missing or API errors occur, local algorithms provide:
  - Summary generation (sentence scoring + keyword weighting)
  - Keyword extraction (frequency-based, common-word filtering)
  - MCQ generation (contextual distractors + definitions)

This ensures the app remains usable even without external AI during demos.

---

## 🌐 Deployment (Vercel)

1) Push to GitHub  
2) Import repo in Vercel → “Deploy”  
3) Add env vars (`OPENAI_API_KEY`) in Vercel Project Settings  
4) Redeploy if env vars were added after the first build

Optional  
- Try to claim a neat domain like `notegenius.vercel.app` or add a custom domain
